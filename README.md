🌟 Overview
This project implements a Question Answering (QA) system using:
✔ Fine-tuned BERT model for better accuracy
✔ LangChain for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
✔ Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface

The system retrieves relevant information and generates answers based on the fine-tuned model’s knowledge.

✨ Features
✅ Custom Fine-Tuned BERT – Trained on QA datasets for better performance
✅ RAG Pipeline – Combines retrieval & generation for accurate answers
✅ Streamlit UI – Simple and interactive interface
✅ API Endpoint – Can be integrated into other applications

# 🛠 Installation
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bert_Finetuned_langchain_QA.git
cd Bert_Finetuned_langchain_QA
Install dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
1. Run the RAG API
Start the FastAPI server:

python rag_inference_api.py
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000.

2. Launch the Streamlit App
Run the web interface:


streamlit run UI_for_rag.py
Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser to ask questions.

# ⚙ Configuration
Before running, set the model path in rag_inference_api.py:

MODEL_PATH = r"your/model/path"  # Replace with your model directory

⚡ Performance Notes
⚠ Current Limitations:

The BERT model was trained for only 5 epochs due to hardware constraints.

Accuracy may vary depending on the input questions.

For better results, consider:

Using OpenAI embeddings for retrieval

Training for more epochs

Using a larger dataset
